# Functional-AS-PCE
Functional Active Stateful PCE

This PCE is based on the code of the [PCE prototype](https://github.com/girtel/n2p-plugins-activePCE) wich was presented in the paper: 

Jose-Luis Izquierdo-Zaragoza, Jose-Juan Pedreno-Manresa, Pablo Pavon-Marino, Oscar Gonzalez de Dios and Victor Lopez, **“Dynamic Operation of an IP/MPLS-over-WDM Network Using an Active Stateful BGP/LS-Enabled Multilayer PCE,”** in *Proceedings of the 18th International Conference on Transparent Optical Networks (ICTON 2016)*, Trento (Italy), July 2016.

This functional PCE is being tested with real equipment ([Juniper Edge Router MX240](http://www.juniper.net/us/en/products-services/routing/mx-series/mx240/))
